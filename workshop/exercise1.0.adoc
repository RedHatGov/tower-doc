= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands

---
****


For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.


====
*Step 0:* Define your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run
commands or your playbook(s).  Use ```vi``` or ```vim``` to create a file called ```hosts```.  Then, add the appropriate definitions for the node that will function as a web node.

.hosts (example)
[source]
----
[web]
node-2 ansible_host=tysons.node.2.redhat-fierce.io
----

*Step 1:* Let's start with something really basic - pinging a host.  The ```ping``` module makes sure our web hosts are responsive.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m ping
----
*Step 2:*  Now let's see how we can run a good ol' fashioned Linux command and format the output using the ```command``` module.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o
----
*Step 3:* Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The ```setup``` module displays ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m setup
----
*Step 4:* Now, let's install Apache using the ```yum``` module
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
----
*Step 5:* OK, Apache is installed now so let's start it up using the ```service``` module
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
----
*Step 6:* Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the httpd service
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped" -b
----
*Step 7:* Next, remove the Apache package
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -b

====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, ```ansible``` allows for long-form options as well as short-form.  For example:

----
ansible web --module-name ping
----
is the same as running
----
ansible web -m ping
----
We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop
