# Asciidoc template for Red Hat Public Sector Workshops

### Usage

Install `ascii_binder`. 

	http://www.asciibinder.org/latest/guides/user_guide.html


Use git to track your changes. 

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit on docs repo"
```

Add a new folder to the repo full of the new `adoc`s you are commiting. 

```
mkdir resources
cd resources
touch newfile.adoc
```

Then add the folder and file structure to the `_topicmap.adoc`

```
---
Name: Resources
Dir: resources
Topics:
  - Name: Resource
    File: newfile.adoc
```

Then build it with `asciibinder`. This will build a website with html, css, and js in `_preview`. From here you can take that folder and deploy it to a webserver of your choice.

```
$ asciibinder
```
